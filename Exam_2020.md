## Oppgave 1

### Which of the following situations may lead to a loss of packets in a packet-switched network

1. A hosts informs a packet-switch that it decided not to transmit the packet anyway
2. Buffers overflow because too many packes arrive for transmission on a communication link
3. Interference of signals on a communication link causing some of the transmitted bits in the packet to be changed

**Correct:** 2. and 3.

### What is traffic intensity a measure of?

1. The amount of bits/second presented to a link for transmission
2. The amount of bits received on an incomring communication link
3. A relation between the amount of bits presented per time unit for transmission on the communication link and the rate with which the bits can be transmitted

**Correct:** 3.

### What does it mean that the transport layer provides a reliable data transfer service

1. The receiver may only receive some of the data sent by the sender
2. The data sent by a sender equals the data received by the receiver and the order is preserved
3. The data sent by a sender is equal to the data received by the receiver

**Correct:** 2.

### What is the role of the forwarding function executed at the network layer

1. To compute the least cost routes(paths) in the network
2. To transfer datagrams from incoming links to the appropriate outgoing link
3. To provide diagnostic information in case of network errors

**Correct:** 2.

### What is the purpose of the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

1. To configure a network interface with an IP address
2. To configure a network card with a link-layer(MAC) address
3. To map an IP address into the corresponding link-layer(MAC) address

**Correct:** 3.

### Client-centric consistency protocols are about

1. Making sure that there is a systemwide consistent view on a data store
2. Providing consistency for a single client that accesses different replicas
3. bot 1. and 2.

**Correct:** 2.

### A replicated-write protocol which is based on majority voting is called

1. Coherence-based protocol
2. Local-write protocol
3. Remote-write protocol
4. Quorum-based protocol

**Correct:** 4.

### A key reason to use a probabilistic flooding model in flooding-based multicasting is to

1. Create a structured overlay network
2. Increase the number of messages to ensure reliability
3. Reduce the number of messages in the network

**Correct:** 3.

### An example of location independent name is

1. An IP address
2. A domain name
3. A telephone number

**Correct:** 2.

### Which of the following is an example of cloud computing service models?

1. Business as a service
2. Software as a service
3. Utility as a service

**Correct:** 2.

## Oppgave 2

related to project 1 on socket programming and RPC middleware

### List the three protocol layers that were implemented in the project and explain briefly how they are related

IoT application layer, RPC layer and Messaging layer. The messaging layer was on top of TCP and was used to implement the RPC layer for remote-procedure calls. The RPC layer was then used byt the IoT application layer to implement the sensor-display-controller IoT system at the application layer

### The java socket API and the TCP transport service were used in the implementation. What two elements are being used to identify a socket (communication endpoint) at the transport layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack

A socket represents a communication endpoint and is identified using a port number and an IP address
