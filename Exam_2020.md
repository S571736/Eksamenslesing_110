## Oppgave 1

### Which of the following situations may lead to a loss of packets in a packet-switched network

1. A hosts informs a packet-switch that it decided not to transmit the packet anyway
2. Buffers overflow because too many packes arrive for transmission on a communication link
3. Interference of signals on a communication link causing some of the transmitted bits in the packet to be changed

**Correct:** 2. and 3.

### What is traffic intensity a measure of?

1. The amount of bits/second presented to a link for transmission
2. The amount of bits received on an incomring communication link

2. The data sent by a sender equals the data received by the receiver and the order is preserved
3. The data sent by a sender is equal to the data received by the receiver

**Correct:** 2.

### What is the role of the forwarding function executed at the network layer

1. To compute the least cost routes(paths) in the network
2. To transfer datagrams from incoming links to the appropriate outgoing link
3. To provide diagnostic information in case of network errors

**Correct:** 2.

### What is the purpose of the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

1. To configure a network interface with an IP address
2. To configure a network card with a link-layer(MAC) address
3. To map an IP address into the corresponding link-layer(MAC) address

**Correct:** 3.

### Client-centric consistency protocols are about

1. Making sure that there is a systemwide consistent view on a data store

1. Coherence-based protocol
2. Local-write protocol
3. Remote-write protocol
4. Quorum-based protocol

**Correct:** 4.

### A key reason to use a probabilistic flooding model in flooding-based multicasting is to

1. Create a structured overlay network

3. Reduce the number of messages in the network

**Correct:** 3.

### An example of location independent name is

1. An IP address
2. A domain name
3. A telephone number

**Correct:** 2.

### Which of the following is an example of cloud computing service models?

1. Business as a service

3. Utility as a service

**Correct:** 2.

## Oppgave 2

related to project 1 on socket programming and RPC middleware

### List the three protocol layers that were implemented in the project and explain briefly how they are related

IoT application layer, RPC layer and Messaging layer. The messaging layer was on top of TCP and was used to implement the RPC layer for remote-procedure calls. The RPC layer was then used byt the IoT application layer to implement the sensor-display-controller IoT system at the application layer

### The java socket API and the TCP transport service were used in the implementation. What two elements are being used to identify a socket (communication endpoint) at the transport layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack

A socket represents a communication endpoint and is identified using a port number and an IP address

### The messages exchanged in task 1 of the project has a fixed length of 128 bytes. Explain briefly the purpose of the first 8 bits in the messages and why they are needed

The first byte is interpreted as an int to tell how many of the subsequent 127 bytes is payload data. This is needed because the messages have a fixed length of 128 byte, leaving room for 127 bytes of data. But not all messages have 127 bytes of data.

### In task 2 of the project: When the server receives an RPC request from a client, how does the server identify the method to be invoked

The server side uses the identifier sent with the RPC request to look up the method to be invoked

**Correct:** The first byte of an RPC request message which is carried as a payload data in the fixed-size message at the messaging layer is used to specify the number of the RPC method. This number is then used to lookup the method in the RPC table on the RPC server.

**Correct but made correct:** The first byte in RPC request message which is carried as a payload data is used to specify the number of the RPC method.

### Sketch briefly how the message format in Task 1 of the project could be extended such that it would be possibly to arbitrarily long messages

The problem is similar to fragmentation with the exception that the individual parts cannot be reordered because messaging takes place over TCP. Hence, the first bit of the byte specifying payload length could be used to indicate whether this message is the last message of a longer message or not. This would leave 7 bits to specify payload length between 0 and 127.

## Oppgave 3

### Why are layering and protocol stacks used for implementation of data networks

Layering and protocol stacks are used to break up the complexity of data networks in smaller subproblems. This makes it possible to integrate different network technologies in a network-of-networks such that application can be developed without having to consider the complex internal structure of the data network. It also makes it possible to replace protocols at a given layer without having to make changes to the layer above or under.

### What is the difference between a protocol and a service

Protocol constitutes the rules that are implemented at a given layer in the protocol stack and governs the communication between entities at that layer. A protocol implements the service provided by the layer above to the layer above in the protocol stack. Protocol can be seen as implementing a service

### The TCP/IP protocol stack is used to construct a network of networks (the internet). All network cards have a link-layer (MAC) address and all network interfaces are configured with an IP network-layer address. Why are IP addresses used - would it not suffice to just use link-layer addresses

Link-Layer (MAC) addresses do not have any hierarchical structure as IP addresses have. Hence, use of link-layer addresses would not allow for route aggregation which is important for scalability of forwarding tables in the internet. Also, different link-layers may have different format of addresses which would prevent a uniform address space.

## Oppgave 4

### Explain briefly what service the DNS system implements, and the function of the fields: Flags, Questions and Answers

DNS system constitute a distributed database that makes it possible to map hostnames (e.g. google.com) to an IP address. In a typical scenario, Flags are used to indicate whether the message is a query or a reply message, Questions are to hold host names that are to be mapped to IP addresses, and answers will contain IP addresses

### Describe briefly how the DNS protocol works by outlining a typical exchange of messages between a DNS client adn a DNS server

The DNS protocol typically operates by the client sending a DNS query containing a host name to a DNS server. When the DNS server receives the query, then it may either iteratively or recursively contact other DNS servers until it eventually returns a DNS reply to the DNS client containing the IP address of the hostname that was to be resolved

### Assume that a DNS client has sent multiple DNS queries and receives a DNS reply. How can the client find out which DNS query that the DNS reply matches

The identification field of the DNS message is used to specify an identifier that can be used to match queries and replies

### The DNS primarily uses UDP as a transport service. Why is UDP and not TCP used to send DNS requests and replies

The DNS protocol typically involves a request and a reply after which the communication is completed. The overhead of establishing a TCP connection would therefore be relatively high compared to the amount of data that needs to be exchanged. In case a DNS client does not receive a reply because a DNS message was lost, the DNS client can simply retransmit the query
